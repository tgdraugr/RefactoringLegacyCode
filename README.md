# Refactoring Legacy Code

This code serves the purpose of practising refactoring techniques on legacy code. The goal came from Dave Farley's [Continuous Delivery course on Refactoring Legacy Code](https://courses.cd.training/courses/refactoring-legacy-code-video-tutorial), where he demonstrates techniques like *Approval Testing*, *Refactoring* and *Decluttering*.

Therefore, the main goal is to make a bad code testable and cleaner.
